## Panda recipes...?

Not panda recipes üêº..

_pandas_ recipes. This kind --> [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/overview.html)

pandas is an open-source Python package for _data analysis_ and manipulation.

It is hugely popular with Data Scientists, Data analysists, Data Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers, and more.
It's a fantastic project and one of my favorite go-to packages.
