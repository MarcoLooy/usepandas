Suppose you have a set of .csv files that you need to combine into one file, while keeping the header information.

Luckily, using the pandas package in Python, you can do this relatively easily.

In this example, you have two .csv files. `homes.csv` and `homes1.csv`

### homes.csv

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1        |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4        |
| 132 Walrus ave  | 299,001 | 2        |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3        |

### homes1.csv

| Address        | Price   | Bedrooms |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 491 Python St  | 293,923 | 4        |
| 938 Zeal Rd    | 148,398 | 2        |
| 247 Fort St    | 299,238 | 3        |
| 992 Settled St | 823,049 | 4        |

## How to append multiple .csv files with pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read in your .csv files as dataframes using pd.read_csv()
df_homes = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/kennethcassel/homes.csv")
df_homes1 = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/kennethcassel/homes1.csv")


# This method combines a list of pandas dataframes into one dataframe
pd.concat([df_homes, df_homes1])

# pd.concat accepts a list as an argument. If you had another homes.csv
# file to append you could add it to the list
# like pd.concat([df_homes, df_homes1, df_homes2])
```

If you'd like to export the file as a new csv, your code will look like this:

```python
import pandas as pd

df_homes = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/kennethcassel/homes.csv")
df_homes1 = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/kennethcassel/homes1.csv")


pd.concat([df_homes, df_homes1]).to_csv('homes_complete.csv', index=False)

```

## Resulting combined .csv file

### homes_complete.csv

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1        |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4        |
| 132 Walrus ave  | 299,001 | 2        |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3        |
| 491 Python St   | 293,923 | 4        |
| 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | 2        |
| 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | 3        |
| 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4        |
