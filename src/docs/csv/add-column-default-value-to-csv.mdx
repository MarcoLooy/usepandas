Let's look at how simple it can be to add a new column of some default information to a .csv file using
Python pandas.

Suppose you have this set of data and you want to add a column to specify whether or not
the home has been inspected by a home inspector. So far, none of the houses have been inspected,
so we want to set all the column values to false.

We'll need to add a new column called `Inspected` and set the value to 'false' for each one.

## homes_sorted.csv

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4        |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3        |
| 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | 3        |
| 132 Walrus Ave  | 299,001 | 2        |
| 491 Python St   | 293,923 | 4        |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4        |
| 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | 2        |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1        |

## How to add a new column with Python pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

df_homes = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/kennethcassel/homes_sorted.csv")

# To make a new column with values that are all the same,
# do the following. Name the column, and assign it to a single
# default value. This will populate every row with that value.
df_homes['Inspected'] = 'false'

df_homes.to_csv('homes_inspected.csv, index=False')

```

## Resulting file with new column added

### homes_inspected.csv

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms | Inspected |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4        | false     |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3        | false     |
| 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | 3        | false     |
| 132 Walrus Ave  | 299,001 | 2        | false     |
| 491 Python St   | 293,923 | 4        | false     |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4        | false     |
| 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | 2        | false     |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1        | false     |
