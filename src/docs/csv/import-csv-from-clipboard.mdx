Your colleague sends you a .csv file in slack and wants you to do some quick
transformations on it.

Good news! You don't have to save these .csv files to your machine, get the file
path, and load it into a pandas dataframe.

There's an easier way!

It's called `pandas.read_clipboard()`

## How to use pandas read_clipboard()

For this example, your colleague sends you this .csv in slack with housing
data. He'd like it sorted from largest to small by bedrooms.

### homes_sorted.csv

Here is what the original .csv file looks like

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4        |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3        |
| 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | 3        |
| 132 Walrus Ave  | 299,001 | 2        |
| 491 Python St   | 293,923 | 4        |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4        |
| 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | 2        |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1        |

### Import data using read_clipboard()

Copy .csv to clipboard here: [homes_sorted.csv](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kennethcassel/a59a5f0e302e9b7452d18c275eb16447/raw/723460a571f8bd4261116936b672c2f015b78ffa/homes_sorted.csv)

```python
import pandas as pd

# read_clipboard attempts to read whatever is in your
# clipboard in as a .csv file. It uses read_csv() under
# the hood.
df = pd.read_clipboard(delimiter=',')

# sort data by bedrooms
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by=["bedrooms"])

# export dataframe as .csv file
sorted_df.to_csv('homes_sorted_by_bedroom.csv', index=False)
```

### homes_sorted_by_bedroom.csv
