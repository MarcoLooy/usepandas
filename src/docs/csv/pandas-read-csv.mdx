If you're looking to perform analysis on .csv data with pandas, you will first have to get the information
into pandas. The most common way of getting .csv data into a pandas dataframe is by using the pandas `read_csv()` function.

Let's look at some data that we'd like to pass into pandas. We have the following .csv `homes_sorted.csv` and we'd
like to do some analysis on it.

### homes_sorted.csv

Here is what the original .csv file looks like

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4        |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3        |
| 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | 3        |
| 132 Walrus Ave  | 299,001 | 2        |
| 491 Python St   | 293,923 | 4        |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4        |
| 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | 2        |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1        |

## So how exactly can we read in this .csv?

### Read .csv using pandas read_csv

Copy .csv to clipboard here: [homes_sorted.csv](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kennethcassel/a59a5f0e302e9b7452d18c275eb16447/raw/723460a571f8bd4261116936b672c2f015b78ffa/homes_sorted.csv)

```python
# This is a convention. Most people import pandas as pd.
import pandas as pd

# You can pass a filepath or a file-like object into the read_csv function.
# Here, we are passing in a filepath. the read_csv function returns a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('/Users/kennethcassel/homes_sorted.csv')

# Our csv has been loaded into a DataFrame called df. We can perform all types of
# useful operations on it. For now, we will just return the entire dataframe

df
```

### df

Wait a minute. Our data has been changed. Scroll back up to the .csv we passed in and see if
you notice the difference.

|     | Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --- | --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 0   | 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4        |
| 1   | 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3        |
| 2   | 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | 3        |
| 3   | 132 Walrus Ave  | 299,001 | 2        |
| 4   | 491 Python St   | 293,923 | 4        |
| 5   | 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4        |
| 6   | 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | 2        |
| 7   | 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1        |

### Why did pandas add a new number column to our data?

Pandas DataFrames and Series always have an index. This is a number that displays next to the columns.

When you export your .csv you can pass in the flag `Index=False` to prevent this index from showing up in
your data.
