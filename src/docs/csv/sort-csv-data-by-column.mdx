**Sorting data** by a column value is a very common task for Data analysts
who use Python pandas.

For this example, let's say you're trying to sort a .csv file that contains
housing data. üè†
In particular, you're wanting to sort from highest to lowest, based on price.

You start with a .csv for this task that looks like this:

### homes.csv

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1        |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4        |
| 132 Walrus ave  | 299,001 | 2        |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3        |
| 491 Python St   | 293,923 | 4        |
| 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | 2        |
| 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | 3        |
| 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4        |

### Sort data in a .csv file with Python pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read in your .csv files as dataframes
# df is a common standard for naming a dataframe. You can
# name them something more descriptive as well.
# Using a descriptive name is helpful when you are dealing
# with multiple .csv files.
df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/kennethcassel/homes.csv")

# the .sort_values method returns a new dataframe, so make sure to
# assign this to a new variable.
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by=["price"], ascending=False)

# Index=False is a flag that tells pandas not to write
# the index of each row to a new column. If you'd like
# your rows to be numbered explicitly, leave this as
# the default, True
sorted_df.to_csv('homes_sorted.csv', index=False)
```

### homes_sorted.csv

Here is the resulting csv file from just a few lines of pandas code!

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4        |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3        |
| 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | 3        |
| 132 Walrus Ave  | 299,001 | 2        |
| 491 Python St   | 293,923 | 4        |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4        |
| 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | 2        |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1        |
